# 🧠 Obesity Multiclass Classification Problem

Obesity is a significant health issue affecting millions globally. This project leverages machine learning to classify individuals into various obesity categories based on multiple features. By analyzing factors such as age, gender, physical activity, diet, and medical history, the model aims to predict whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a set of features (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle habits, diet), the goal is to predict one of the following obesity categories:

| Class | Category             |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | insufficient_weight  |
| 1     | normal_weight        |
| 2     | obesity_type_i       |
| 3     | obesity_type_ii      |
| 4     | obesity_type_iii     |
| 5     | overweight_level_i   |
| 6     | overweight_level_ii  |

This is a **multiclass classification** problem where the model must predict one of the seven classes.

## 📊 Approach

The classification task is addressed using several machine learning algorithms and evaluated using relevant performance metrics.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [`ObesityDataSet.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/) sourced from Kaggle.
