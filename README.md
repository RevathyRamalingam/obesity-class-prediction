Obesity Multiclass Classification Problem

Obesity is a significant health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. This project uses machine learning to classify individuals into different obesity categories based on various features. By analyzing factors such as age, gender, physical activity, diet, and medical history, the model aims to predict whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

The classification problem is addressed using several machine learning algorithms and evaluated using relevant metrics.

Problem Statement

Given a set of features (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle habits, diet, etc.), the goal is to predict one of the following obesity categories:

Class 0: insufficient_weight
Class 1: normal_weight
Class 2: 'obesity_type_i
Class 3: obesity_type_ii
Class 4: obesity_type_iii
Class 5: overweight_level_i
Class 6: overweight_level_ii

This is a multiclass classification problem where the model must predict one of the seven classes.
